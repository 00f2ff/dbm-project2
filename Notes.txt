Scope:
 - Most populous city in each state
 - xxx restaurants per city of a particular category / search term

Metrics:
 - Take 'rating' and 'review_count' from each business

Search Specifications:
 - Change sort to "Highest Rated" and update offset

Computation:
 - Multiply rating by review_count for each state to find weight
  o Add weight to one list, and review_count to a total_review_count variable
  o Divide weight by total_review_count and store for each state in dict format


Things to keep in mind:
 - The rating Yelp returns for each restaurant is rounded somehow
 - Yelp uses an algorithm to decide which restaurants are the highest-rated which is dependent on both rating and review_count

Starting categories
Chinese: 'chinese'
Pizza: 'pizza'
Mexican: 'mexican'
Bars: 'bars'

Passing to appspot data structure:
Except this is a value of key "Pizza" or any category used.
For saving purposes: file saved as "Pizza.json"
{
	"DC": {
		"city": "Washington",
		"population": 700000,
		"rating": 3.8,
		"reviews": 8000
	},...
}

File save data structure:
{
	"DC": {
		"city": "Washington",
		"restaurants": [ ... ]
	},...
}

Make this look nice later

Team feedback:
 - Add state names to each state --> going to be too time-intensive (and may screw up SVG)
